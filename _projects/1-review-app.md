ReView is an app that allows users to learn what's recyclable and compostable in their area by taking a photo of an item. The app uses a convolutional neural network to classify the item and a database of rules to determine if it's recyclable or compostable. It's built using a React Native/TypeScript frontend and a Firebase/AWS Sagemaker backend.
