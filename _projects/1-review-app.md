I built an app that allows users to learn what's recyclable and compostable in their area by taking a photo of an item. The app uses a convolutional neural network to classify the item and a rule-based system to determine if it's recyclable or compostable. It's built using a React Native/TypeScript and a Firebase/AWS Sagemaker backend.
