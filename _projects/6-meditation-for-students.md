When I entered college in 2013, I was embarrassed to tell my new roommate that I would be meditating daily. Meditation was taboo at the time, but I found it to be a useful tool for stressing management and focusing in class. I founded a meditation organization to normalize it. By the end of the college, the org had hundreds of members and most people I knew had become practitioners.
