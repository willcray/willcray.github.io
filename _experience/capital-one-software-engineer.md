My current adventure is at Capital One in NYC, working on [Paribus](https://www.paribus.co). Paribus is a service that monitors online purchases from your mailbox (email) for price drops, and automatically files claims for you within the window of their price protection policy. I work on the backend team, developing our Python stack and building new components in Go.

More to come!
