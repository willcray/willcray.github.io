I worked on making Intel's server platforms reliable enough for use in autonomous vehicles. I joined Intel's Autonomous Driving Group as the most junior engineer by eight years, and was promoted to senior engineer within a yearâ€”on par with a new Ph.D. graduate despite holding only a B.S. I led research on Linux as a potentially safety-critical OS, analyzing failure risks and writing kernel modules in C for mitigation. I also owned software safety requirements for Intel's first autonomous driving platform, developing a deep understanding of our complex hardware and software systems. As the Functional Safety technical lead, I led a team on a key component of the Xeon autonomous driving platform and introduced a new methodology that reduced requirements by 30-50%, streamlining work across teams.
