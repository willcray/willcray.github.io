I love working on meaningful problems, so after university, I joined **Intel's Safety Team within their Autonomous Driving Group**. I was the most junior engineer by eight years. I was promoted to the **"senior" engineering level after just one year of work**: the grade level commensurate to a graduating Ph.D. despite only having a B.S. I was also told at this time that management in my organization saw me as a future Principle Engineer--Intel's highest, most-selective grade level for engineers.

**I developed excellent software, hardware, and decision making skills**. I performed research on Linux for one of our clients as a potentially safety-critical operating system. I analyzed mulitple key mechanisms of  Linux for potential failures and wrote three kernel modules in C to mitigate the potential failure. I also wrote a research paper covering the Linux mechanisms, their potential failures, and mitigation methodologies. I also owned the software safety requirements for Intel's first autonomous driving platform. In order devleop requirements, I had to understand how our software and hardware worked, how the components interacted on a system level, and how they could fail. I loved learning how to make decisions which carry serious implications and that depend on both an complete awareness of assumptions and a thorough understanding of a complex system.

**I developed strong leadership skills.** I was the Functional Safety technical lead for three months on one of the three major components within Intel's Xeon autonomous driving plaform, leading a team of five engineers, some of which were 25 years older than me. I also sought a more-efficient methodology for how the organization performed a safety analyis that drove hundreds of platform-wide software and hardware safety requirements. In most cases, the new methodology **reduced the amount of downstream requirements 30-50%** percent, resulting in a elimination of weeks to months of overhead for our software, hardware, and validation teams. I presented this methodology to the organization, and it was accepted as the new, standard process. I also successfully mentored a summer intern and guided her through the implementation of a tool that would enable engineers to deploy the improved analysis methodology.
