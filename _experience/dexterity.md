I'm currently a Senior Machine Learning Engineer at Dexterity, a robotics startup (raised $200M+ from Kleiner Perkins and Lightspeed). We're developing advanced robotics to automate warehouse tasks for companies like UPS and FedEx. I'm the perception machine learning lead, developing the core algorithms that enable Dexterity's robots to see and navigate their environments. I've focused primarily on instance segmentation models and their surrounding infrastructure. I've trained over 30 iterations of models and deployed them to production on Dexterity's robots. I've also built most of the infrastructure that supports Dexterity's machine learning systems, including model training, evaluation, and deployment.
