        <p>
          I grew up in Kansas City and went on to attend the University of Virginia (UVA).
          I graduated with <i>high distinction</i> from UVA, where I double majored in Computer and Electrical Engineering,
          and minored in Business. I did this while launching <i>Meditation for Students</i>, a university-sponsored
          student organization to encourage the proliferation of meditation practices to help students better manage the chaos of attending an elite, academic
          university.
        </p>

          After graduating from UVA, I worked as a Functional Safety Systems Engineer and Architect within Intel's
          Autonomous Driving Group. I learned a great deal about how safety-critical software and hardware systems operate, and how
          to make decisions that could impact the safety of hundreds of thousands of people. I was the most junior engineer by about eight
          years; still, I operated as the technical lead for a team of five senior engineers. Together, our team delivered one of three major
          components in Intel's platform on-time. I was promoted to "senior engineer" after one year of work and was told I was on track to be a Principle Engineer.
        </p>

          I left Intel to further my understanding of AI through a M.S. in Computer Science at UT Austin, and I'll graduate in December 2020.
          I'm currently solving interesting problems in Data Science on a contractual basis, while playing around with some startup ideas. I love the process of creatively solving open-ended and challenging problems &#150; a daily task for most entrepreneurs.
          I also love developing my understanding of the world, and I plan to leverage that understanding to
          create an organization that solves meaningful problems in an ethically-responsible way.
