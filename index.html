        Hi! I'm Mike Verdicchio, a software engineer at Capital One working on
        <a href="https://www.wikibuy.com">Wikibuy</a> and
        <a href="https://www.paribus.co">Paribus</a> in New York City. I grew up
        a few miles north of Richmond, VA in Mechanicsville. I graduated in 2017
        from the University of Virginia, earning my Bachelor of Science in
        Computer Engineering in the School of Engineering & Applied Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm definitely a collector of interests. I'm fascinated by electronics
        and low-level firmware/driver development, which led me to studying
        computer engineering instead of computer science. I'm passionate about
        entrepreneurship, empowering aspiring engineers, and a long life of
        education. I'm also a firm believer in the UVA mentality of a
        Jeffersonian Engineer: one that can do great engineering work, but also
        understand the societal impacts of their designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the far future, I see myself as a technology pioneer. Being an
        engineer, my end goal is to design things that excite people in this
        world. I'm interested in being a part of developing the circuitry and
        controls behind cutting-edge electronics that bring new and improved
        ways of living our lives, such as artificially intelligent robots,
        engine controllers, and audio electronics. For this reason, I see a
        graduate degree in my future, either in engineering or business. I'm
        also very interested in Patent and Intellectual Property Law and hope to
        one day incorporate that into my career.
